# urlCloud

This project started from a desire to build an URL Shortener and the timely publication of a [Real Python Tutorial](https://realpython.com/build-a-python-url-shortener-with-fastapi/) on specifically that topic.

urlCloud allows for the creation of time or click based expirations on shortened URLs.
